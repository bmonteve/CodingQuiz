# CodingQuiz

This code functions by initially showing a mainpage with the rules of the quiz, type of quiz questions, and submit button when the user is ready to start. 

Once the quiz starts the program will run through each question and provide a user with 4 possible answers. It gives the user 60 seconds to finish the quiz with a 10 second penalty for wrong answers. 

Once the quiz is finished or time runs out, the user will be prompted to store their score with their initials. It gives them the option to go back to the main page or clear highscores after displaying their submited score. 

The highscores page is available at anytime during the quiz and will exit and not store user's score if clicked during the quiz.
